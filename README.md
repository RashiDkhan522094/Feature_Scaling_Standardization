# ðŸ§® Feature Scaling: Standardization & Normalization

This project demonstrates practical implementations of **feature scaling** techniques using scikit-learn, with sideâ€‘byâ€‘side comparisons and visualizations. The aim is to show how scaling methods affect model performance.

---

## ðŸš€ Techniques Covered

- **StandardScaler** â€” mean = 0, variance = 1  
- **MinMaxScaler** â€” scales features to a fixed range (e.g. [0,â€¯1])  
- **RobustScaler** â€” median and IQR based scaling, robust to outliers  
- **Normalizer** â€” scales samples to unit norm
